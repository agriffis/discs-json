The Glitch has the diameter of a putter and is PDGA approved as well, making it truly the best of both worlds. With flight numbers of 1 | 7 | 0 | 0, the Glitch is the first MVP disc with 7 glide — just a flick of the wrist is all that stands between you and a game of catch on the beach or an approach to the green! Neutron Soft plastic makes the Glitch easily catchable when throwing around with a friend, but it also makes the Glitch an awesome approach or scramble disc because of its tendency to sit where it lands.</p>\n<p>Its neutral flight path makes it a tremendous first disc to learn with — making it a great first disc for players with Ultimate frisbee backgrounds and lower power players! Available in 140g-154g, don’t let its light weight fool you, the Glitch has enough aerodynamic stability and glide to be a useful tool on the course. For anyone who loves to throw discs, either on the course or just playing catch, the Glitch makes an awesome companion for a fun time and some awesome lines. There’s a spot in every player’s bag for the Glitch!</p>\n"

After sitting down with James and talking about his passions, it became clear that the concept of travel and exploration was going to be the bedrock of the James Conrad Line. With that in mind, James wanted to use his Line to showcase some of his favorite places and experiences on Earth. As luck would have it, months before he would go on to win the World Championships in Utah, Arches National Park was chosen as our Nomad concept —James Conrad definitely has some magic to him.</p>\n<p>From there, we had to formulate how to blend the unique themes of the James Conrad Line with those of the MVP brand itself. Mixing science with nature, much like Axiom’s representation of art, was definitely something we were looking forward to, and Art Director Mike Inscho was more than up to the task. For the Electron Nomad specifically, Mike’s inspiration was to represent Arches with audio-like waveforms — creating a topographical waveform of a trailhead that is close to James’ heart. With just enough nods to MVP themes so as to enhance, not overwhelm, the core concepts of the James Conrad Line, the Nomad truly represents the partnership between James and MVP. The results speak for themselves, and we can’t wait to see what Mike and James have in store for us next.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

Combining the raw speed and distance potential of the Octane with our cutting edge Fission™ plastic has resulted in a truly impressive max distance driver. In testing at MVP R&amp;D, the Fission™ Octane presented with a touch more turn than in other plastics &#8211; helping it be perhaps the farthest flying Octane yet. With final flight numbers of 13 | 5 | -1.5 | 2, the Fission™ Octane is going to take your distance to the next level. Plus, thanks to its ultralight core, the Fission™ Octane is available in weights all the way down to 155g —  making it an Octane for all arm speeds! See just where your distance potential is at with the Fission™ Octane!</p>\n<p>Octane falls in the general stability lineage of Switch, Amp, Inertia, and Wave, with a slow-turning profile that holds long and straight until its fade finish. The 23mm Octane is designed to be relatively less understable than its 21.5mm counterpart Wave. Average throwers should see straight flights with a bit of shallow turn, while power throwers will be able to hyzerflip for max distance and tailwind lines.</p>\n"

With a high power throw, the Zenith will exhibit just enough distance lengthening turn from a flat release before its confident fade kicks in — displaying the ideal flight pattern for a controlled distance drive. And, thanks to its subtle turn, the Zenith can shape some truly impressive lines from an anhyzer release too. Lower power players will find the Zenith to be workably overstable and dependable into any kind of wind. We have a feeling this disc is going to end up in a lot of bags, so grab a Zenith today and see what the James Conrad Line is all about!</p>\n"
