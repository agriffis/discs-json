      The Guld is an overstable distance driver which will put you further down
      the fairway than ever before. The wider rim, 24 mm, and low profile design
      assure a speedy power shot with glide and predictable fade, even in the
      head wind.

      The Reko X shares many shapes and dimensions with the classic Reko, with
      the concave wing as the most obvious exception. This feature allows a more

    <p>
      The disc’s flight pattern makes it just as competent for touchy flex shots

      This easy-to-use disc might be your secret weapon to perform the lines you

      need massive glide, Svea will deliver. It offers a lower profile than our

      easy to release. Svea is an old Swedish name which is derived from the

      This large diameter midrange disc is slower than our Kaxe midrange driver
