    The Alpha&nbsp;fills the essential go-to fairway slot in every golfers bag.
    Designed to be a true Power Fairway with straight flight and reliable fade,
    the Alpha will respond to the line and power you give it.&nbsp;Capable of
    fighting headwinds or carving up the woods, the Alpha is a uniquely stable
    disc we absolutely love and hope you&nbsp;do too.&nbsp;

    This over stable distance driver jumps out of the hand fast, holds on to
    your line, and then reliably fades forward.

  <p>
    The Grackle is a slightly stable fairway driver. It will compliment the
    current Alpha as a slightly less stable version that will season well and
    turn into a great hyzer flip option. This disc responds well to backhand and
    forehand throws. We find it flies a bit straighter on a flat forehand than
    it does a backhand.<br />
